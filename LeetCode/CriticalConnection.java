https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/
There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections
    forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi.
    Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.
